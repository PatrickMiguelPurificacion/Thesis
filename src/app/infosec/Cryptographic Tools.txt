Cryptographic Tools 

The ability to conceal the contents of sensitive messages and to verify the contents of messages and the identities of their senders have the potential to be useful in all areas of business. To be actually useful, these cryptographic capabilities must be embodied in tools that allow IT and information security practitioners to apply the elements of cryptography in the everyday world of computing. This section covers a number of the more widely used tools that bring the functions of cryptography to the world of information systems.

Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Public-key Infrastructure (PKI) is an integrated system of software, encryption methodologies, protocols, legal agreements, and third-party services that enables users to communicate securely. PKI systems are based on public-key cryptosystems and include digital certificates and certificate authorities (CAs).

Digital certificates are public-key container files that allow computer programs to validate the key and identify to whom it belongs. (More information about digital certificates appears in later sections of this chapter.) PKI and the digital certificate registries they contain enable the protection of information assets by making verifiable digital certificates readily available to business applications. This, in turn, allows the applications to implement several of the key characteristics of information security and to integrate these characteristics into business processes across an organization. These processes include the following:

• Authentication: Individuals, organizations, and Web servers can validate the identity of each of the parties in an Internet transaction.
Integrity: Content signed by the certificate is known to not have been altered while in transit from host to host or server to client.
• Privacy: Information is protected from being intercepted during transmission.
• Authorization: The validated identity of users and programs can enable authorization rules that remain in place for the duration of a transaction; this reduces some of the overhead and allows for more control of access privileges for specific transactions. Nonrepudiation: Customers or partners can be held accountable for transactions, such as online purchases, which they cannot later dispute.

A typical PKI solution protects the transmission and reception of secure information by integrating the following components:

• A certificate authority (CA), which issues, manages, authenticates, signs, and revokes users' digital certificates, which typically contain the user name, public key, and other identifying information.
• A registration authority (RA), which operates under the trusted collaboration of the certificate authority and can handle day-to-day certification functions, such as verifying registration information, generating end-user keys, revoking certificates, and vali- dating user certificates.
• Certificate directories, which are central locations for certificate storage that provide a single access point for administration and distribution.
• Management protocols, which organize and manage the communications among CAS, RAs, and end users. This includes the functions and procedures for setting up new users, issuing keys, recovering keys, updating keys, revoking keys, and enabling the transfer of certificates and status information among the parties involved in the PKP's area of authority. • Policies and procedures, which assist an organization in the application and management of certificates, in the formalization of legal liabilities and limitations, and in actual business use.

Common implementations of PKI include systems that issue digital certificates to users and servers; directory enrollment; key issuing systems; tools for managing the key issuance; and verification and return of certificates. These systems enable organizations to apply an enterprise-wide solution that provides users within the PKI's area of authority the means to engage in authenticated and secure communications and transactions.

The CA performs many housekeeping activities regarding the use of keys and certificates that are issues and used in its zone of authority. Each user authenticates himself or herself with the CA, and the CA can issue new or replacement keys, track issued keys, provide a directory of public key values for all known users, and perform other management activities. When a private key is compromised, or when the user loses the privilege of using keys in the area of authority, the CA can revoke the user's keys. The CA periodically distributes a certificate revocation list (CRL) to all users. When important events occur, specific applications can make a real-time request to the CA to verify any user against the current CRL.

The issuance of certificates (and the keys inside of them) by the CA enables secure, encrypted, nonrepudiable e-business transactions. Some applications allow users to generate their own certificates (and the keys inside of them), but a key pair generated by the end user can only provide nonrepudiation and not reliable encryption. A central system operated by a CA or RA can generate cryptographically strong keys that are considered by all users to be independently trustworthy, and can provide services for users such as private key backup, key recovery, and key revocation. 

The strength of a cryptosystem relies on both the raw strength of its key's complexity and the overall quality of its key management security processes. PKI solutions can provide several mechanisms for limiting access and possible exposure of the private keys. These mechanisms include password protection, smart cards, hardware tokens, and other hardware-based key storage devices that are memory-capable (like flash memory or PC memory cards). PKI users should select the key security mechanisms that provide a level of key protection appropriate to their needs. Managing the security and integrity of the private keys used for nonrepudiation or the encryption of data files is critical to the successful use of encryption and nonrepudiation services within the PKI's area of trust.
