Foundations of Cryptology

Cryptology has a long and multicultural history

Date                                                                            Event

1900 B.C.                     Egyptian scribes used nonstandard hieroglyphs while inscribing clay tablets; this is the first documented use of written cryptography.

1500 B.C.                     Mesopotamian cryptography surpassed that of the Egyptians. This is demonstrated by a tablet that
                              was discovered to contain an encrypted formula for pottery glazes; the tablet used symbols that
                              have different meanings than when used in other contexts.

500 B.C.                      Hebrew scribes writing the book of Jeremiah used a reversed alphabet substitution cipher known
                              as ATBASH.

487 B.C.                      The Spartans of Greece developed the skytale, a system consisting of a strip of papyrus wrapped
                              around a wooden staff. Messages were written down the length of the staff, and the papyrus was
                              unwrapped. The decryption process involved wrapping the papyrus around a shaft of similar
                              diameter.

50 B.C.                       Julius Caesar used a simple substitution cipher to secure military and government communications.
                              To form an encrypted text, Caesar shifted the letter of the alphabet three places. In addition to
                              this monoalphabetic substitution cipher, Caesar strengthened his encryption by substituting Greek
                              letters for Latin letters.

Fourth                        The Kama Sutra of Vatsayana listed cryptography as the 44th and 45th of the 64 arts (yogas) that
to sixth                      men and women should practice:(44) The art of understanding writing in cipher, and the writing
centuries                     of words in a peculiar way; (45) The art of speaking by changing the forms of the word.


725                           Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Khalil ibn Ahman ibn ‘Amr ibn Tammam al Farahidi al-Zadi al Yahmadi
                              wrote a book (now lost) on cryptography; he also solved a Greek cryptogram by guessing the
                              plaintext introduction.

855                           Abu Wahshiyyaan-Nabati, a scholar, published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt
                              magic formulas.

1250                          Roger Bacon, an English monk, wrote Epistle of Roger Bacon on the Secret Works of Art and of
                              Nature and Also on the Nullity of Magic, in which he described several simple ciphers.
  
1392                          The Equatorie of the Planetis, an early text possibly written by Geoffrey Chaucer, contained a
                              passage in a simple substitution cipher.

1412                          Subhalasha, a 14-volume Arabic encyclopedia, contained a section on cryptography, including both
                              substitution and transposition ciphers, as well as ciphers with multiple substitutions, a technique
                              that had never been used before.

1466                          Leon Battista Alberti, the Father of Western cryptography, worked with polyalphabetic
                              substitution and also designed a cipher disk.

1518                          Johannes Trithemius wrote the first printed book on cryptography and invented a steganographic
                              cipher, in which each letter was represented as a word taken from a succession of columns. He also
                              described a polyalphabetic encryption method using a rectangular substitution format that is now
                              commonly used. He is credited with introducing the method of changing substitution alphabets
                              with each letter as it is deciphered.

1553                          Giovan Batista Belaso introduced the idea of the passphrase (password) as a key for encryption;
                              this polyalphabetic encryption method is misnamed for another person who later used the
                              technique and is called “The Vigenère Cipher” today.

1563                          Giovanni Battista Porta wrote a classification text on encryption methods, categorizing them as
                              transposition, substitution, and symbol substitution.

1623                          Sir Francis Bacon described an encryption method employing one of the first uses of steganography; 
                              he encrypted his messages by slightly changing the type-face of a random text so that
                              each letter of the cipher was hidden within the text.

1790s                         Thomas Jefferson created a 26-letter wheel cipher, which he used for official communications
                              while ambassador to France; the concept of the wheel cipher would be reinvented in 1854 and
                              again in 1913.

1854                          Charles Babbage reinvented Thomas Jefferson’s wheel cipher.

1861–5                        During the U.S. Civil War, Union forces used a substitution encryption method based on specific
                              words, and the Confederacy used a polyalphabetic cipher whose solution had been published
                              before the start of the Civil War.

1914–17                       During World War I, the Germans, British, and French used a series of transposition and
                              substitution ciphers in radio communications throughout the war. All sides expended considerable
                              effort to try to intercept and decode communications, and thereby created the science of
                              cryptanalysis. British cryptographers broke the Zimmerman Telegram, in which the Germans
                              offered Mexico U.S. territory in return for Mexico’s support. This decryption helped to bring the
                              United States into the war.

1917                          William Frederick Friedman, the father of U.S. cryptanalysis, and his wife, Elizabeth, were
                              employed as civilian cryptanalysts by the U.S. government. Friedman later founded a school for
                              cryptanalysis in Riverbank, Illinois.

1917                          Gilbert S. Vernam, an AT&T employee, invented a polyalphabetic cipher machine that used a
                              nonrepeating random key.

1919                          Hugo Alexander Koch filed a patent in the Netherlands for a rotor-based cipher machine; in 1927,
                              Koch assigned the patent rights to Arthur Scherbius, the inventor of the Enigma machine, which
                              was a mechanical substitution cipher.

1927–33                       During Prohibition, criminals in the U.S. began using cryptography to protect the privacy of
                              messages used in criminal activities.

1937                          The Japanese developed the Purple machine, which was based on principles similar to those of
                              Enigma and used mechanical relays from telephone systems to encrypt diplomatic messages. By
                              late 1940, a team headed by William Friedman had broken the code generated by this machine
                              and constructed a machine that could quickly decode Purple’s ciphers.

1939–42                       The Allies secretly broke the Enigma cipher, undoubtedly shortening World War II.

1942                          Navajo code talkers entered World War II; in addition to speaking a language that was unknown
                              outside a relatively small group within the United States, the Navajos developed code words for
                              subjects and ideas that did not exist in their native tongue.

1948                          Claude Shannon suggested using frequency and statistical analysis in the solution of substitution
                              ciphers.

1970                          Dr. Horst Feistel led an IBM research team in the development of the Lucifer cipher.

1976                          A design based upon Lucifer was chosen by the U.S. National Security Agency as the Data
                              Encryption Standard and found worldwide acceptance.

1976                          Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman introduced the idea of public-key cryptography.

1977                          Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman developed a practical public-key cipher for both
                              confidentiality and digital signatures; the RSA family of computer encryption algorithms was born.

1978                          The initial RSA algorithm was published in the Communication of ACM.

1991                          Phil Zimmermann released the first version of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy); PGP was released as
                              freeware and became the worldwide standard for public cryptosystems.

2000                          Rijndael’s cipher was selected as the Advanced Encryption Standard.
